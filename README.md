# SandboxGame

## What is to keep in mind

The sever is only here for :
- Storing data (player, player position, player inventory etc..)
- Computing data (player position += sent position)

The client is only here to :
- Display data sent (all player objects) by the server through the game engine  
- Get and send inputs from the User
